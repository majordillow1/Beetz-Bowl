# Beetz-Bowl
# What is Beetz-Bowl?
Beetz-bowl is a custom lightweight project that is meant for gatherings of people at a single location to add music from youtube to a streaming device.
# What is so special about Beetz-Bowl that signifies it from other similar projects?
Nothing really. I (majordillow1) wanted a project to work on. Asked a friend what he thought would be a good project. He spouted off the idea of Beetz-Bowl, I asked him for a name to the project and started in on it. Then began collaboration with keenanmat. I guess the only thing that may seperate this project from others' is the fact that keenanmat and I plan on bringing a standalone device, a small video wall connected to speakers in a room or throughout a house to act as a host for streaming the music. keenanmat has added some changes for the frontend because I'm a terrible artist and we also added youngkingken for front end graphic development.
